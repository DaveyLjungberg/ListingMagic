# Claude Instructions

> **DEPRECATED**: This file has been replaced by the new agent workspace system.
> 
> Please use:
> - **`CLAUDE.md`** - Master instruction file (Claude Code reads this automatically)
> - **`.agent-workspace/`** - Agent memory, context, and knowledge base
> - **`.cursorrules`** - Cursor-specific instructions
>
> The new system provides:
> - Project-specific context (not generic templates)
> - Bug tracking and solution memory
> - Reusable prompts (no more bouncing between LLMs)
> - Session logging for continuity
>
> See `CLAUDE.md` for full instructions.
